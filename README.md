# solids-vis-1

## Short description
A python program that interfaces with blender to produce visualizations related to solid bodies and their motions or deformations.


## About

This project would develop a program in python as an interface with blender, a general-purpose 3D modeling tool. The program would produce visualizations related to solid bodies and their motions or deformations. In future versions the software could take advantage of colors or materials in the 3D modeling tool to repreesnt temperature, stress, or other states on the solid along with animating deformations and motions. The developed program would take output from well known, standard simulation tools or custom simulations, convert it to a standard input for the software, and create custom visualizations for it.

As an example case, simulations from this repository will be visualized in our software.

Here is an example hand-made animation of what we plan to create programatically.
